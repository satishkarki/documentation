The purpose of this post is to help me keep track of the commands I come across as I dive into my networking journey. I'm working through the Official Cert Guide by Wendell Odom and configuring these commands on my Catalyst 2960-CX switch.

Let’s start from the very beginning. Grab your popcorn—things are about to get interesting!

I've been seeing a lot of these animated diagrams popping up all over the internet lately. Naturally, I was curious about how they were made. Turns out, it’s super easy with [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). Just use the flow animation feature, save it as an SVG file, and voila—instant animated diagram magic!

Now, I know this has absolutely nothing to do with the CISCO commands we’re about to dive into, but hey, I got sidetracked. Alright, enough about pretty diagrams—let's get back to the main event!
