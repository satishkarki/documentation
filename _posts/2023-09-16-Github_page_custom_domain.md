So, I thought to my self, why not start a blog. A blog about the things, I love doing. The first thing I needed was a good text editor. Dennis Simpson and his [courses](https://zonzorp.github.io/) about Information System Security introduced me to the Linux world. The guy was a wizard with Vim. I wished to be like him. Here I am now, with [The Ultimate Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-markdown-cheat-sheet-3d3976b31a0) and the book **Mastering Vim** by Ruslan Osipov hoping one day I will be like Dennis.
